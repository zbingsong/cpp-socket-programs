crc_encoder.h & crc_encoder.cpp:
  A standalone CRC encoder, able to:
  1. get CRC code of a binary string
  2. generate a binary string encoded with CRC
  3. verify that an encoded binary string has no bit error 
  (to the extent of what CRC can do)

parity2d_encoder.h & parity2d_encoder.cpp:
  A standalone 2D parity encoder, able to:
  1. get row and column parity bits of a binary string
  2. generate a binary string encoded with 2D parity
  3. verify that an encoded binary string has no bit error
  (to the extent of what 2D parity can do)

crc_tx.cpp:
  Reads dataTx.txt, extract all binary strings, encodes them
  with CRC, and print out the encoded string and its CRC code

crc_rx.cpp:
  Reads dataRx.txt, extracts all binary strings, and checks if
  each string has bit errors

crc_vs_parity2d.cpp:
  Reads dataVs.txt, extracts all binary strings and their 
  corresponding error bits, encodes each string by CRC and 2D 
  parity, induces errors on the encoded strings with error 
  bits, and try to detect the errors with CRC and 2D parity
