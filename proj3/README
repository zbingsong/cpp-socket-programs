servermain creates a ServerProgm object, which sets up a server socket
and listens for incoming connections. For each connection, it creates
a new socket dedicated for this connection and forks a child process
to handle this socket.
client creates a ClientProgm object, which sets up a client socket and 
connects to the server socket at predefined address and port. It then
sends the client port number as client ID, and queries for department
name input by user to server.

  contains the main() function, creates ServerProgm object that handles
  all server activites
serverprogm.h
  class definition for ServerProgm, exposes a few static constants and
  two public methods: setup_server() and run_server()
